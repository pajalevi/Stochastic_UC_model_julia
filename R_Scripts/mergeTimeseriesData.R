# mergeTimeseriesData.R
# reads in timeseries data from multi-period runs

# loadTimeseriesData reads in the designated type of timeseries data

# loadproduction is its precursor, which load slow and fast production data
# concatenates them, and merges multiple periods

# loadTimeseriesData()
# consolidates a given type of timeseries data from multiple runs of ercot_stoch.jl model
# and saves it as a single file
